# STK Metadata Extractor

This script will read an STK scenario with an instance of STK Engine to extract metadata from that scenario.

As a Code Example, this script should demonstrate how users can iterate through all objects in a scenario and interrogate each object type for information related to that specific type.

This is a work in progress but the goal will be to create a summary file (formatted in XML, JSON or other) to briefly describe the scenario contents.

# Usage

This script is intended to be used from the command line with two arguments: 
1. the path to a scenario file (*.sc or *.vdf).
2. the desired path of the output file (*.xml or *.json) 

Example:
python StkMetadataExtractor.py "c:\Temp\sampleScenario.vdf" "c:\Temp\summary.xml"

The output summary.xml file will briefly describe the contents of the scenario.
